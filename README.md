# viginere-cipher
A simple viginère cipher encryption/decryption software in C!
I was wanting a simple project on a night when I couldn't sleep, just to keep my programming fingers active. Use the script to compile and run, or just use the pre-made executable! I have always liked the Viginère cipher since I was a Ruby Redfort fan as a child, so I thought why not make a way to easily create and decrypt coded messages in this format?

## how to run
  cd ~/path/to/file

  ./ViginereCipherInator
